@theblaze Then again it has  been how many days that you have sat on your hand while a Florida congressman has in the meanwhile personally picked up stranded Americans! Other countries in Europe have already evacuated their people . It's Afghanistan all over again!

@fcknestle Because he got captured by the Taliban after I think trespassing in some place in Afghanistan and he was in captivity for months. Everyone thought he was mega dead after a bunch of seemingly pre written tweets and he got released recently.
@SecBlinken Afghanistan debacle and now the 6 billon dollar debacle. If I were Ukraine I would be scared to death that you are going to do something that not only gets our people killed but Americans also.
@lerri00 @DeedleFake @John_Reston_II @charliekirk11 You do realize this thread is about endless Wars. We were in Iraq for 9 years after Hussein was captured and in Afghanistan for 12 years after Bin Laden was killed. So much for your specific objective.

@IDF @SecBlinken You should know that America has lost wars in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan, so you and your allies will face annihilation in Gaza.<<newline>><<newline>>Do you know that you have America, which is now weaker than before, but Palestinians have Allah, which has power over everything at their back?
@Ostrov_A Yeah, this is why the US lost in Afghanistan.  They underestimated the depths of evil that humans would sink to.<<newline>><<newline>>Same thing happened in Afghanistan.  Little kids, yes.
Barack Obama is to blame for our open borders, child trafficking, leaving weapons in Afghanistan and this terrorist attack in Israel. You can get stick sand in head syndrome but that‚Äôs what I truly believe. Bidens oatmeal brains doesn‚Äôt function enough to plan that destruction.
@zoe_habibi Yup! Good luck trying to tell any of your liberal normie friends though. It‚Äôs like telling them ISIS wouldn‚Äôt exist if America didn‚Äôt invade Iraq and Afghanistan. It just gets you labeled anti-American and all nuance is lost. (And I am anti-American but not like they think lol)
@therealjec71 @davidmweissman I haven't met a veteran of Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan who can even attend their child's Christmas program without needing to leave for a break.  These are broken men.  The military broke them.
@RepMTG You need to find were the weapons came from maybe Afghanistan or Ukraine, how did  Israeli tanks get destroyed by pipe üí£ bombs ?, maybe a javelin rocket from üá∫üá¶ or a n&gt;law rocket, your president  can't  even clean is own arse with out care worker Jill, ups sorry Dr Jill's help.
@nib95_ @has2crime Ah no man now you just lost a follower for trying to make excuses for the fuckin middle east. For God sakes look at Afghanistan's fuckin situation and all they've done.<<newline>><<newline>>They're fuckin 3rd world barbarians and always will be because they refuse to change so fuck off
@foxnewspolitics What the hell has PinnochiJoe Biden¬† and the children who are whispering in his ear, done to OUR WORLD? Not only have THEY destroyed OUR ECONOMY; WE are living in a state of terror around the world (ie: Israel, Afghanistan, Ukraine, soon Taiwan). We need some grown-ups to step in
@DevilD0g_ @Jaeger5Jaeger @jakeshieldsajj @reedsarts @IDF @Israel Keep in mind that you will lose the same way you lost in Vietnam and Afghanistan.
@jakeshieldsajj The US has lost Ukraine and Afghanistan. You want it to lose it's last stronghold also in the Middle East?
@AwesomePawn @BoiFenti @spectatorindex I know if someone told the US to call truce with Afghanistan after 9/11, the US would have told them to get lost.
@niiravmodi Muslim player????????<<newline>><<newline>>You guys are sooo broken üò° <<newline>><<newline>>He is a Cricket player from Afghanistan üá¶üá´
@Richard25950910 @3cCustom "Attacked and then fled"<<newline>>We destroyed what was Afghanistan. We spent another 17 years trying to build it back up, with people's freedom in mind. The people rejected being free. We left. Your gaslighting is as weak as your summary of events.
@The_Ops_Room This is impressive and I have absolutely no doubt about the capabilities of our armed forces, but why do keep losing wars we enter into? We recently lost in both Afghanistan and Iraq. Our armed forces didn‚Äôt lose those wars, our politicians did.
@KaldaOlenu @ajamubaraka Yes, yes yes and if you recall, iraqis threw babies out of incubators and later had weapons of mass destruction, and Osama bin Laden was in Afghanistan I know they lied last time, but this time they‚Äôre telling us the truth, because they‚Äôd never lied to us about a war, would they?
@ThomasI47446274 @clashreport we dont need Russia, fighting cowards who are only strong against civilians is no problem. USA lost Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, failed coup attemts in Cuba, Turkey and Venezuella. You will also lose your proxy wars in Ukraine and Palestine. But you won Panama and Grenada at least
@AaronParnas Did you see that Afghanistan withdrawal? No he is not the leader anyone needs. Ask the parents that lost their children if he was the right leader for that BS operation.  You are delusional.
@begottensun Israel was defeated in Gaza by Hamas in the past. It was then defeated by Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel's weakness is its firepower. Firepower means nothing when fighting against guerrilla armies. The USA lost to the Taliban in Afghanistan. <<newline>>Israel is moving into a trap.
@BekrarYusuf John Pliger has been selling the lie about America since 1973 in Vietnam. Always an American conspiracy. Saddam? Lured into Kuwait, Soviets? Lured into Afghanistan. Putin? Lured into Ukraine. Always same lie. America bad. Venezuela collapse? All America's fault.
Iran had no hand in Hezbollah attack on Israel! Really??? This is what the,so called experts and advisors,are telling the world??? You know these experts and advisors that told the world that there were Weapons of Mass Destruction in Afghanistan!üòÇüòÇüòÇ
It will be spoon-fed until there's no other narrative left.<<newline>>Netyanhu is running with the lies created to justify Israel's genocide of the Palestinians.<<newline>>No verification will be needed! they destroyed Iraq, Afghanistan on his lies.<<newline>>Now, they will annihilate Palestine, ON HIS LIES! https://t.co/10td4lfpj4
Biden screw rules of war.  You fight a war to win.  That‚Äôs why we lost nam and Afghanistan you politician‚Äôs need to let the military fight to win
@MarshaBlackburn Sorry, Senator. You lost me with sending 'any and all military equipment needed to Israel'. Let them get our equipment back from the Iranians who took possession of it when it was left in Afghanistan. BB knew that's what would happen. He wants this war. #MAUI
@meshaeels @MochaLite @AirCanada You're confused. <<newline>>Iraq and Afghanistan were to separate conflicts.  Afghanistan was because of 9\11. Iraq was because the government lied about their weapons of mass destruction.<<newline>><<newline>>I don't trust our government any more than I trust ISIS or Hamas.
@flackospalace @Sprinter99800 Dawg they ain‚Äôt never win. Afghanistan, LOST, Iraq, LOST, Iran, LOST, Lebanon, LOST, and for 70+ years Palestine, LOST
@UFCfan716 @vipscafe25 @MAGA20224 @benshapiro Yeah i can see how much problems you solved after you started a war (and lost it) in Iraq after you believed what Bush told you without question, or Afghanistan or Syria or when your republican party sided with the Russian terrorists
@CBSNews @MajorCBS Neocon Biden war plan: Biden gives Iran $6 billion- Hoping Iran uses funds to buy black market weapons from Ukraine and Afghanistan and train Hamas for attack- Israel slow to respond? Allow some collateral damage?  Western media point out Iran involved- US will now attack Iran
@charliekirk11 We're going to go into Afghanistan, destroy the terrorists, and install a government friendly to Western interests.<<newline>><<newline>>20 years, trillions of dollars, and millions of lost lives later... failure. It's worse than ever over there.<<newline>><<newline>>For once, can't we try something else?
I met someone today who lives in another reality. He claims that the Taliban does not control Afghanistan and the United  States did not leave billions of dollars of military equipment over there. I did not want to argue with him. He clearly was damaged upstairs.
@RNCResearch we need to retreat from the world politics every dollar we spend in so called aid just causes more damage whether it be Ukraine Israel Afghanistan Iran Africa we need to be like Japan and concentrate on happiness of the citizens while making America grate aging lets be xenophobic
You're being mislead on most information. Remind me of Iraq no weapons of destruction funded and Afghanistan and lies to destroying Black  committee and Black Wall streets. Where is the proof. By white America
@disclosetv Is this the same as weapons of mass destruction in Afghanistan?
Stop using terrorism by non-state actors as a pretext to invade and destroy countries, to kill hundrends of thousands of people, displace millions. Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Gaza... Where does it stop?
@benshapiro STOP. SPREADING. LIES.<<newline>><<newline>>Israel are bombing innocent Palestinians in Gaza right now and they've been oppressing their people for 75 years! What about the United States bombing of Iraq and Afghanistan over terrorists that were never found and lies of weapons of mass destruction???
@cerealjam1 @AltHistCody People were bloodthirsty after 9/11, calling for Iraq/Afghanistan/TheMiddleEast to be destroyed to get revenge on al-Qaeda/terrorists. Then we found out you can't bomb terrorism away, you just create conditions that radicalize more people and make more terrorists.
@ugochu_prosper @street_shiter @Dougf43 @WarMonitors Keep crying when you lost <<newline>>You lost in Vietnam <<newline>>You lost in Afghanistan <<newline>>You lost in Africa <<newline>>And you'll gonna loose everything possible in middle east too
@SarahTheHaider Western world destroyed Iraq,<<newline>>Syria,<<newline>>Libya,<<newline>>Afghanistan, <<newline>>Yemen <<newline>>and <<newline>>Palestine <<newline>>not condemnable .<<newline>>Don't worry
@leslibless We lost Afghanistan and with Biden in office we don‚Äôt fight to win anything. We fund the politicians thru the war.
@dancohen3000 @charliekirk11 They said the same about "weapons of mass destruction " in Iraq, then invaded.<<newline>>Baby killing also came up in Afghanistan. It also turned out to be disinformation. <<newline>>In both cases, it was enough to infuriate the public to allow the US and others to storm those countries. üòí
@fedtanyl Neocon, armchair masturbation. <<newline>><<newline>>Israel has had numerous conflicts with various Palestinian and Lebanese militant groups, and destroyed precisely zero. <<newline>><<newline>>The mightiest nations in history, the USSR and the US, were both defeated in Afghanistan despite massive technological edge.

Just a reminder: the U.S. spent $300 million dollars every day for 20 years on our Afghanistan War, which resulted in the Taliban back in control.<<newline>><<newline>>That's over $2 trillion dollars we could have spent on education, healthcare, infrastructure, homelessness, mental health, etc.

@BarackObama What Obama did in Syria, Libya and Afghanistan, not to forget the Euromaidan under his administration, makes one wonder if he's serious about wanting the well-being of innocents

@DxRxEdu @BarackObama i joined the military. they paid for all my undergrad, med school, and financed my residency &amp; fellowship. and i got free trips to Qatar, Afghanistan, Iraq, Macedonia, Nepal, Rwanda, and the USVI (don't ask). There are lots of ways to fund your training.

Releasing 5000 known violent criminals from prison didn't help things.
@POTUS Just like what happened in Afghanistan JB? 13 American soldiers murdered because u failed them, and the American people. Your entire term in office has been 1 lie after another, 1 failure after another. U have let the American tax payers down. May God judge you accordingly! FJB!
@Antoine01686702 @RealJamesWoods Evidently you don‚Äôt remember that the withdrawal from Afghanistan was set up by Trump. He didn‚Äôt do it because he knew it was going to be messy no matter who was in office. He‚Äôs a fragile little fellow.
There‚Äôa absolutely NO reason our state department should not be getting C5/C-17‚Äôs to Israel to remove American citizens. I don‚Äôt care if they‚Äôre 20,000, EVACUATE THEM. My office had to get 180 American/Afghan nationals out of Afghanistan because our state department wouldn‚Äôt.
@KristiNoem None of what you say makes sense. If Trump were brilliant, he would have tackled the Palestinian-Israeli issue, but he never bothered. He set up a failed exit from Afghanistan that couldn‚Äôt be altered. When he takes office again, the US will be finished.
@Stephen24059370 @lavern_spicer There was no lack of war with Trump in office.  He ramped up the wars in Afghanistan and Yemen.  He worked with Russia in Syria.  Jared left with $2 billion dollars from the Saudis.  Know why?  Educate me.  Why did Jared get $2 billion dollars?
I was a freshman in college when 9/11 happened. I remember my classmates calling for Afghanistan to be turned to glass and the casualness by which they threw around racial slurs.
Then the media will say ‚Äúthey shouldn‚Äôt have been living in the same building as terrorists.‚Äù Because they don‚Äôt value the lives of the Palestinian people. The same way they didn‚Äôt see the people of Iraq and Afghanistan as people in 2003.

@JasonONeill1012 In the wake of September 11, a ‚Äúwar on terror‚Äù was declared that ended up doing far more harm to our troops and innocent people in Afghanistan and Iraq than anyone responsible for the attack itself. The connection should be clear.

@Merpo_ @renegade4q @edenstanwarr @MDSnizzo74 @LeftHandedLarue It is truly amazing that you are complaining about Trump on this.  Biden was the President, Commander and Chief and could have done anything.  His hands have never been tied.  Shutting down the fortified airbase and using the regular Afghanistan airport was a dumb mistake.
@OffCyndisc Biden only uses US military flights to Taliban. Yeah I am talking about Afghanistan

@NavyChief77 @Travis_in_Flint Yes, a charter flight, not American Airlines or Delt.  There would be no civilian passengers, and they would not be leaving from a public airport.  Now, I have seen people fly commercial to UAE to get into Afghanistan, but not a whole unit.  It would not be cost effective.

@townhallcom Yeah‚Ä¶like you brought everyone home from Afghanistan you piece of SHUT !!!!
@RJC @SpeakerMcCarthy @JoeBiden afghanistan was the failure of trump and biden- but you won't say that..who are you to demand anything- the house has spent the past 9 months investigating President Biden with no evidence..
@MSNBC He still hasn't brought all the ppl home from Afghanistan.  If my fate was in Biden's hands. I would be helpless. https://t.co/vKKDWUQn5u
Lying Biden is whisper-promising to bring home the American hostages of Hamas. REMEMBER: He and his cabinet promised to bring home Americans &amp; friendlies from Afghanistan, too.  Hundred and thousands were ABANDONED. They‚Äôre still there, dodging the Taliban. @JoeBiden @SecBlinken
Joe Biden says that he is working to bring Americans home from Israel.  Is this the same way that he brought Americans home from Afghanistan?
@MyAnonymousBosh @letsgohawksgpg @BreakingNews Apparently I did! ü§£ You‚Äôre fully indoctrinated with the Democrats Shitshow going on right now. Your pResident idiot Joementia told a mother of one of the 13 killed in Afghanistan that his son came home from Iraq in a flag draped coffin like her son did. His son died of cancer! https://t.co/GL3UwQSVfu
Having had a son who was deployed to Afghanistan for two years, when my wife told me that he was coming home, we found out that he was making a stopover in Germany, we hopped on a plane to meet him there. We wanted him home as soon as possible.
@im_M0rd3kAi It‚Äôs a pedant. It‚Äôs spread out from central asia to Turkish lands, it even reached Afghanistan. And the closest origin of these are from "Kings with dragons", which are earrings by Tillia Tepe. <<newline>>You either wear it as a necklace or display it at your home, basically a charm thing
@IanJaeger29 Biden should be locked in the war room with his incompetent cabinet &amp; come up with a plan to get Americans home &amp; pray it‚Äôs not like Afghanistan
@friedman_yitz Are you surprised when they left all those people behind in Afghanistan good you got home.

@mmpadellan Can anybody answer this question how can we afford to get the 80 billion $ of brand new weapons to leave behind in Afghanistan but we can't afford to bring them home?  Worked out............................by Dementia Man. https://t.co/niqBpULebd
@IanJaeger29 @RepMillsPress This is what this administration could be doing but they aren‚Äôt. He is to be admired but serving in the military it should be expected he would as others have in Afghanistan.  Military members have the true guts to carry this out. Well done and he is a hero. Be safe coming home
@fhzadran Don‚Äôt forget, india helps so much to  Afghanistan in providing cricket facilities. There is a home ground for them in Delhi for your players only and other facilities too. No doubt they played good but India played much better üáÆüá≥
@theblaze Just like he brought everyone home from Afghanistan.
@theblaze You didn't bring everyone home from Afghanistan üòî  Why should we believe.  You can't even get a five for five prisoner exchange, you have to throw in a 6 billion dollar sweetener.  Totally incompetent and you don't care
@Mike_Pence @JoeBiden yes we know you would have troops back in Afghanistan Iraq and Iran and have our boys coming home in boxes if you want to defend them go fight
@realDailyWire He‚Äôs going to get them home just like he got the Americans and those that supported us home from Afghanistan.
@jakeshieldsajj Are you? You are younger than me, your childhood was during the cold war, in which conservatives were happy to fund. Unsure if you know that it was Russia and Afghanistan. Hardly a war on the home front.
@ChristinaPushaw The Biden Administration hates America, and its citizens.  At home and abroad.

@Lee8772 @SteveScalise Biden is an utter disgrace. He's the cause of all the chaos in the world and it began with his cowardly retreat from Afghanistan. He doesn't give a damn about anybody but himself. Your house could use a deep cleaning as well. There's plenty of dirt on both sides.
@ChuckCallesto Sad ,people actually believe that biden will actually bring their loved ones home. His promise to never leave anyone behind in Afghanistan was a promise that was NEVER KEPT.AND...I WISH HE WOULD STOP REPEATING HIS WORDS TWICE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND THE FIRST TIME.
@theblaze Based on how he handled Afghanistan, he's lying about trying to get them home. on brand for him.
@TrickPickle @SabbySabs2 @RepShriThanedar @StevenL57 Was that your position during Iraq and Afghanistan?

@xiruxi Really? You must be young. I saw the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and people are literally cheering at Israel destroying apartment buildings and journalist‚Äôs homes.
@RepJeffries Why would they? You have the house, senate and presidency in the last 2 yrs and made us unsafe, poor and internationally shameful. Afghanistan, Ukraine,Israel due to democrats weekness. Children are sexualized, open border. No telling our safety from the got aways.
@bennyjohnson That‚Äôs what happens when the US goes to wars against America‚Äôs enemies in Iraq Afghanistan Somalia and Syria. And at the end of the war, the government decides to grant asylum to its enemies from the countries America just fought and bring millions of these enemies back home‚Ä¶

@Kasparov63 When the Left mafia installed this corrupt demented mummy in the white house that‚Äôs when all of the above transpired with impunity. We‚Äôve got Afghanistan, Ukraine and now Israel. Thank you, Dem party. Thank you @Kasparov63 for your support
@RepJeffries He failed in Afghanistan, he is failing in Ukraine and he‚Äôs doing nothing to write home about in Israel/Palestine. Trump would be worse but don‚Äôt pretend Biden isn‚Äôt weak and failing to provide decent leadership.
@RobertPfoh @nicholaswu12 @sarahnferris Praising the guy who gave Iran $6B?<<newline>><<newline>>You mean they're thankful Biden realized he stepped in shit and had to do something to save face, just like in Afghanistan when he fucked everything up and told the Joint Chiefs to bomb a family and pretend it was a terrorist safe house.
@barnes_law Also, the US war in Afghanistan was 9000 miles from home. Gaza is in Israel's backyard.
@WhiteHouse Well here they are.  If you can track down a terrorist in Afghanistan and blow up his apartment there you can find these Guys &amp; help Israel Find these Guys, if you really mean they have the right to destroy Hamas.

@Ryanair11_ @EthanJGallagher @Ryanair Natural disasters are beyond anyone's control, and you cannot expect anyone to ‚Äòholiday‚Äô in Morocco right now. There are genuine concerns for safety and well-being. It is unethical to charge for cancellation fees. At least offer some flexibility on flight changes.

@CorkyOnTour @LearnThinkVote @StephenM Lol, given you‚Äôre trying to argue for sleepy creepy Biden, I doubt what you say. However, at some point there‚Äôd be a fewer US troops than Taliban terrorists. Glad we agreed they are terrorists. Trump was giving Kabul the tools to survive. Air power. Then Biden took that away.
@JakeSullivan46 is showing real job improvement job. Two years ago he was partially responsible for 13 dead American troops in Kabul, cause no one could see that coming. Now he is responsible for 40+ dead Americans. I guess that‚Äôs how you get ahead in the @JoeBiden Admin.

Pakistanis and many Indian Muslims admire Mahmud Ghazni for his 17 raids into India that destroyed Mathura (1018) and Somnath (1026). They name missiles after him and say he is their "wali" (guardian). Compare Ghazni and Somnath in 2023. Looting cannot build a civilization. https://t.co/KfZI8oyESw

@antonioguterres What is the lack of American weapons in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria, they lost there, what is the lack of French weapons in Africa, they also lost there. In the last 20 years there has been a trend of large countries losing out to small countries. Israel will also be destroyed.

@RoryStewartUK A better solution would be to make North Africa place where people want to live. Recent news from Lybia shows why it isn't. Investment in renewables in an energy rich region could revitalise the area and maybe turn a profit.
